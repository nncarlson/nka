Nonlinear Krylov Acceleration
=============================
Nonlinear Krylov Acceleration (NKA) [1] is a method for accelerating the
convergence of fixed-point (Picard) iterations. Many Newton-like and inexact
Newton methods are fixed point iterations. The NKA project provides the
canonical implementation of the method for several programming languages.
The black-box accelerator is simple to integrate into existing code. Placed
in the iteration loop, it observes the sequence of solution updates and
replaces them with improved updates using information it has gleaned from
previous solution iterates.

It was only recently recognized (2011 [2]) that NKA is essentially equivalent
to Anderson Acceleration [3] for a specific choice of mixing parameter.
NKA was independently devised by Miller in 1990 in a different application
context using a very different approach, and though it leads to the same
algebraic method, NKA's organization is somewhat different, and arguably
superior. The NKA approach also provides clear rationale for the proper
choice of Anderson's arbitrary mixing parameter.

The NKA method was first described in the final section of [1]. A much more
detailed description of it and a comparison with Anderson Acceleration can
be found in [4]. A description can also be found in the slides `doc/nlk.pdf`.

Using NKA
---------

Several different versions of NKA are provided here:
* The directory `src-F95` contains the original Fortran 95 implementation.
  (The original implementation was in Fortran 77.)
* The directory `src-F08` contains a newer object-oriented version implemented
  in modern Fortran. That version requires a compiler that supports the 2008
  standard plus perhaps some minor 2018 features.
* The directory `src-F08-vector` contains a version of `src-F08` that operates
  with abstract vector objects rather than contiguous rank-1 arrays as in the
  other versions. This provides much greater flexibility, but at the expense
  of requiring an application specific implementation of the base vector class.
* The directory `src-C` contains a C version, which is a straightforward
  translation of the F95 version.

The source for these versions consists of one or two source files that can
be easily incorporated into your own software project. They all feature
essentially the same interface, which is documented in the comments at the
top of the source file.

Each of these versions also contain an example program that illustrates how
to use NKA by solving a nonlinear elliptic equation on a regular 2D grid.
There is a simple CMake-based build system. A simple `cmake .` in the sub-
directory, followed by `make` will build the `nka_example` program. If `cmake`
has problems finding your Fortran compiler, try setting the `FC` environment
variable to the path to it. For a test, output from `nka_example` should be
compared to that in `reference_output`. The "F08" and "F08-vector" example
programs are a bit more elaborate, allowing several problem and method
parameters to be set on the command line. Use the `--help` option to get
usage information. You can get a better idea of how NKA behaves by
experimenting with these programs.
