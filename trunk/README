Several different versions NONLINEAR_KRYLOV_ACCELERATOR are provided here:

o The directory "src" contains the original Fortran 95 implementation in
  the standalone module NONLINEAR_KRYLOV_ACCELERATOR.  It makes use of a
  Fortran version of design-by-contract implemented in the source files
  f90_assert.fpp and f90_assert.f90.  The latter source is not used at all,
  however, if the module is compiled with the preprocessor variable NDEBUG
  defined.
  
o The directory "src-C" contains a C implementation of the accelerator in
  the file nonlinear_krylov_accelerator.c and associated header file.

o The directory "src-C++" contains a C++ implementation of the accelerator
  that is compatible with Trilinos. The example nlkain-trilinos.cpp 
  contains a simple PDE example (that is adapted from one of the NOX
  examples in Trilions' Didasko package). This example shows how to use
  the provided classes with Trilinos.
  
The programming interface to each implementation is described in the
comments at the beginning of the source file.  The interfaces are very
similar to one another, but are adapted to the language. The programming
interface for the C++ classes is explained in the example 
src-C++/nlkain-trilinos.cpp and to some extend in src-C++/README.

A simple description of the acceleration procedure is given in the foils
found in the doc directory.  The procedure is also described at the end of
the paper by Carlson and Miller, SIAM J. Sci. Comput, 19 (1998) pp 728-765.

Each directory also contains a test program which shows how to use the
accelerator by solving a nonlinear elliptic equation on a regular 2D mesh.
There is a makefile (which will need to be modified for your compiler) that
will build the test program.  Output from the program should be compared to
that in reference_output to verify the code.  Note that the test problem
is the same for each implementation and the results should all be the same.
