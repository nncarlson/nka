===============================================================================

fpa-1.0.0 (2004/02/18):

o This is the initial CVS version of the code, and is based on the 1996
  version, with the following changes:
  
  - A few MFE-code specific couplings were eliminated.
  
  - Vectors stored as rank-2 arrays (natural in the MFE context) have been
    replaced by rank-1 arrays, which is more typical of actual usage.
    
  - All the data describing the state of the acceleration procedure has been
    encapsulated into a derived type that is now passed to the procedures,
    permitting multiple acceleration processes to be active simultaneously.
    The original version stored the state as module data, which limited the
    procedure to a single instance.
    
  - More code comments.

o Code released under the extremely permissive MIT license.

o Included is a test code that demonstrates the usage of the accelerator
  by solving a nonlinear elliptic equation on a regular 2D grid.
  

Early, pre-CVS History:

o The acceleration procedure was originally implemented in a Fortran 77 code
  circa 1990, and used in the gradient-weighted moving finite element codes
  of Carlson and Miller.  Their 1998 SISC papers, which describe these MFE
  codes, also includes a description of the acceleration procedure.

o The code was reimplemented in Fortran 90 about 1995 as part of a new suite
  of moving finite element codes.  The latest version is dated 1996/06/15.
