This directory contains an example code that shows how to use 
a custon direction factory with NOX. In particular, the 
direction we use is the NLA direction. 

The files in this directory are:

Makefile (edit to where indicated in the file)

NKA.H                   nonlinear Krylov accelerator class
NKA.cpp

NKADirection.H          custom direction class that adheres to 
NKADirection.cpp        the Trilions requirements for such a class
                        and uses the NKA class

NKADirFactory.H         custom direction factory class that 
NKADirFactory.cpp       adheres to the Trilions requirements and 
                        uses the NKADirection class

nlkain-trilinos.cpp     contains a simlpe PDE example (adapted from 
                        ex2.cpp in the NOX examples in the Didasko 
                        package, it shows how to use the classes above 
                        (NKA, NKADirection, NKADirFactory).
