o The module FIXED_POINT_ACCELERATOR is a standalone module.  It makes use
  of a Fortran version of design-by-contract implemented in the files
  f90_assert.fpp and f90_assert.f90.  The latter source is not used at all,
  however, if the module is compiled with the pre-processor variable NDEBUG
  defined.
  
o The programming interface to the module is described in the comments at
  the beginning of the source file.  A simple description of the acceleration
  procedure is given in the foils found in the doc directory.  The procedure
  is also described at the end of the paper by Carlson and Miller,
  SIAM J. Sci. Comput, 19 (1998) pp 728-765.
  
o In the test directory there is a test program which shows how to use the
  accelerator by solving a nonlinear elliptic equation on a regular 2D mesh.
  To compile the program, a link to the appropriate machine configuration
  file in the config directory needs to be made.  For example,
  
    ln -s linux-x86-lahey config
    
  Output from the program should be compared to that in reference_output
  to verify the code.
