This directory contains an example code that shows how to use 
a custon direction factory with NOX. In particular, the 
direction we use is the NLA direction. 

The code in this directory was used to generate the numerical
tests that are presented in the paper

The files in this directory are:

Makefile (edit to where indicated in the file)

NKA.H                    nonlinear Krylov accelerator class
NKA.cpp

NKADirection.H           custom direction class that adheres to 
NKADirection.cpp         the Trilions requirements for such a class
                         and uses the NKA class

NKADirFactory.H          custom direction factory class that 
NKADirFactory.cpp        adheres to the Trilions requirements and 
                         uses the NKADirection class

BroydenSMDirection.cpp   custom direction class that adheres to
BroydenSMDirection.hpp   the Trilions requirements for such a class
                         implements Broyden's method as described in
                         C.T. Kelley's book "Iterative Methods for
                         Linear and Nonlinear Equations"

BroydenSMDirFactory.cpp  custom direction factory class that
BroydenSMDirFactory.hpp  adheres to the Trilions requirements and
                         uses the BroydenSMDirection class

nlkain-trilinos.cpp     contains a simlpe PDE example (adapted from 
                        ex2.cpp in the NOX examples in the Didasko 
                        package, it shows how to use the classes above 
                        (NKA, NKADirection, NKADirFactory, BroydenSMDirection,
                        and BroydenSMDirFactory).
