!!
!! This module implements the nonlinear Krylov accelerator (NKA) introduced
!! in [1] for fixed point or Picard iterations.  Placed in the iteration loop,
!! this black-box accelerator listens to the sequence of solution updates and
!! replaces them with accelerated updates.  More generally, NKA can accelerate
!! typical quasi-Newton iterations, which can usually be viewed as a fixed
!! point iteration for a preconditioned function.
!!
!! This is a Fortran 2008 adaptation of the original Fortran 95 version that
!! implements the methods as type bound procedures.

!! PROGRAMING INTERFACE
!!
!! This module defines the derived data type NKA, which encapsulates the state
!! of the acceleration procedure, with the following methods as type bound
!! procedures.
!!
!!  INIT(VLEN, MVEC) initializes the object to handle as many as MVEC vectors
!!    of length VLEN.
!!
!!  SET_VEC_TOL(VTOL) sets the vector drop tolerance.  A vector is dropped
!!    from the acceleration subspace when the sine of the angle between the
!!    vector and the subspace spanned by the preceding vectors is less than
!!    this value.  If not set, the default value 0.01 is used.
!!
!!  SET_DOT_PROD(DOT_PROD) sets the procedure used to compute vector dot
!!    products.  DOT_PROD is a procedure pointer with the same interface
!!    as the intrinsic function DOT_PRODUCT with real rank-1 array arguments.
!!    If not set, the default is to use the instrinsic DOT_PRODUCT.  In a
!!    parallel context where the vector components are distributed across
!!    processes, a global dot product procedure needs to be supplied that
!!    performs the necessary communication internally.
!!
!!  ACCEL_UPDATE(F) takes the function value F, which would be the update
!!    vector in a fixed point iteration, and overwrites it with the accelerated
!!    update computed from the acceleration subspace stored in the object.
!!    This subspace is updated prior to computing the update using F and
!!    the previous function value and update that were cached on the
!!    preceding call to ACCEL_UPDATE, if any. The input F and returned update
!!    are cached for use by the next call to ACCEL_UPDATE.
!!
!!  RESTART() flushes the acceleration subspace, returning the object to its
!!    state after the call to INIT; the next call to ACCEL_UPDATE begins the
!!    process of accumulating a new acceleration subspace.  Typical usage is
!!    to call RESTART at the start of each nonlinear solve in a sequence of
!!    solves.  This allows the object to be reused and eliminates the overhead
!!    of repeated memory allocation and deallocation that would otherwise occur.
!!
!!  RELAX() deletes the pending vectors that were cached by the preceding
!!    call to ACCEL_UPDATE, if any.  This modifies the behavior of the next
!!    call to ACCEL_UPDATE in that the acceleration subspace will not be
!!    updated prior to computing the accelerated update.  This could be used,
!!    for example, to carry over the subspace from one nonlinear solve to
!!    another.  (Whether this is an effective strategy is an open question.)
!!    ACCEL_UPDATE expects that the passed function value is connected to the
!!    preceding update (if it exists), but this is not normally true for
!!    the first call in a subsequent nonlinear solve, and would result in the
!!    subspace being updated with bogus information.  A call to RELAX at the
!!    end of a nonlinear solve prevents this from occuring.
!!
!!  NUM_VEC() returns the number of vectors in the acceleration subspace.
!!
!!  MAX_VEC() returns the max number of vectors in the acceleration subspace.
!!
!!  VEC_LEN() returns the length of the vectors.
!!
!!  VEC_TOL() returns the vector drop tolerance.
!!
!!  REAL_KIND() returns the kind parameter value expected of all real arguments.
!!
!!  DEFINED() returns the value true if the object is well-defined; otherwise
!!    it returns the value false.  Defined means that the data components of
!!    the object are properly and consistently defined.  Due to the significant
!!    effort this function goes through to examine the object, it is primarily
!!    intended to be used in debugging situations.  Note that this function is
!!    used internally when this module is compiled without the preprocessor
!!    -DNDEBUG flag.
!!
!! USAGE EXAMPLE
!!
!!  The following simple example shows the usage of this acceleration
!!  procedure.  For more details, see the associated documentation.
!!  Consider a quasi-Newton iteration for solving the nonlinear system
!!  F(x) = 0.  Suppose PC(y) is some preconditioning procedure that applies
!!  some approximation to the inverse of the Jacobian of F(x) to the vector y.
!!  The original quasi-Newton iteration (equivalent to the fixed point
!!  iteration for PC(F(x)) = 0) would look something like
!!
!!    x = 0
!!    do <until converged>
!!      dx = PC(F(x))
!!      x = x - dx
!!    end do
!!
!!  The accelerated iteration would look something like
!!
!!    type(nka) :: accel
!!    call accel%init (size(v), mvec=5)
!!    x = 0
!!    do <until converged>
!!      dx = PC(F(x))
!!      call accel%accel_update(dx)
!!      x = x - dx
!!    end do
!!
!! The INIT call can be moved outside any nonlinear solution procedure
!! containing this iteration, and a single NKA-type variable used for repeated
!! calls to the procedure. This avoids the repeated allocation and deallocation
!! of memory associated with the accelerator.  In this case, one should either
!! include a call to RESTART before the loop so that each iterative solve starts
!! with clean slate, or include a call to RELAX after the loop so that first
!! call to ACCEL_UPDATE in the next iterative solve doesn't update the
!! acceleration subspace with bogus information.
