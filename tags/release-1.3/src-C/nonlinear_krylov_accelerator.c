 *  NONLINEAR_KRYLOV_ACCELERATOR
 *
 *  Neil N. Carlson <neil.n.carlson@gmail.com>
 *
 *  This code implements the nonlinear Krylov accelerator introduced in [1]
 *  for inexact Newton's (IN) method, where the correction equation of
 *  Newton's method is only approximately solved because the Jacobian matrix
 *  is approximated and/or the linear system is not solved exactly.  Placed
 *  in the iteration loop, this black-box accelerator listens to the sequence
 *  of inexact corrections and replaces them with accelerated corrections;
 *  the resulting method is a type of accelerated inexact Newton (AIN) method.
 *  Note that an IN iteration is merely a standard fixed point iteration for
 *  a preconditioned system, and so this accelerator is more generally
 *  applicable to fixed point iterations.
 *
 *  This code is a straightforward translation of the original Fortran 95
 *  implementation into C.

 *  PROGRAMING INTERFACE
 *
 *  #include "nonlinear_krylov_accelerator.h"
 *
 *  NKA state = nka_create (int vsize, int maxv, double vtol,
 *                          double (*dp)(int len, double *x, double *y));
 *
 *      The function nka_create() creates a new instance of the accelerator
 *      and returns an opaque handle state (of type NKA -- a structure pointer)
 *      to the accelerator.  The acceleration subspace will contain up to maxv
 *      vectors (old vectors will be dropped if necessary) of length vsize.
 *      The argument vtol specifies the vector drop tolerance: a vector is
 *      dropped when the sine of the angle between the vector and the subspace
 *      spanned by the preceding vectors is less than this value.  Acceptable
 *      values are in the interval (0,1) and a reasonable default is 0.01 or
 *      smaller.
 *
 *      The function pointer dp should either be NULL or point to a function
 *      that returns the dot product of two vectors x and y of length len.
 *      If NULL, an internal dot product function will be used; otherwise
 *      the specified function will be used to compute vector dot products.
 *      In a parallel implementation of an interative nonlinear solver where
 *      the vector components are distributed across processors, a global dot
 *      product function that performs the require communication internally
 *      should be specified, for example.
 *
 *  void nka_destroy (NKA state);
 *
 *      The function nka_destroy() frees all the memory associated with the
 *      accelerator state.
 *
 *  void nka_correction (NKA state, double *f);
 *
 *      The function nka_correction() takes the function value f, which would
 *      be the correction vector in a fixed point iteration, and overwrites it
 *      with the accelerated correction computed from the subspace stored in
 *      the accelerator state.  This acceleration subspace is updated prior to
 *      computing the correction using f and the previous function value and
 *      correction that were cached on the preceding call to nka_correction()
 *      (if any).  The input function value f and the returned correction are
 *      then cached in the accelerator for use on the next call.
 *
 *  void nka_relax (NKA state);
 *
 *      A call to nka_correction() caches the passed function value and
 *      returned accelerated correction in state for use on the following call
 *      where they are used to update the acceleration subspace.  The function
 *      nka_relax() deletes these pending vectors from state, so that the next
 *      call to nka_correction() will not update the acceleration subspace
 *      prior to computing the accelerated correction as it normally would.
 *
 *      This can be used to carry over the subspace from one nonlinear solve to
 *      another.  The function nka_correction() expects that the passed function
 *      value is connected to the preceding correction (if it exists), but this
 *      is not normally true for the first call in a subsequent nonlinear solve,
 *      and would result in the subspace being updated with bogus information.
 *      A call to nka_relax() at the end of a nonlinear solve prevents this from
 *      occuring.  Be very cautious when using this strategy; it may not be
 *      appropriate.
 *
 *  void nka_restart (NKA state);
 *
 *      The function nka_restart() flushes the acceleration subspace from the
 *      accelerator state, restoring it to its newly created condition; the
 *      next call to nka_correction() will start the process of accumulating
 *      a new subspace.  Typical usage when doing a sequence of nonlinear
 *      solves would be to call nka_restart() at the start of each nonlinear
 *      solve, allowing a single instance of the accelerator to be reused and
 *      avoiding the overhead of repeated accelerator creation and destruction.
 *
 *  USAGE
 *
 *  The following simple example shows the usage of this acceleration
 *  procedure.  For more details, see the associated documentation.
 *  Consider an inexact Newton iteration for solving the nonlinear system
 *  f(x) = 0.  Suppose pc(y) is some preconditioning procedure; for example
 *  the application of some approximation of the inverse of the Jacobian of
 *  f(x) to the vector y.  The original inexact-Newton iteration (equivalent
 *  to the fixed point iteration for pc(f(x)) = 0) would look something like
 *
 *    x = 0
 *    do <until converged>
 *      v = pc(f(x))
 *      x = x - v
 *    end do
 *
 *  The accelerated inexact Newton (AIN) iteration would look something like
 *
 *    state = nka_create(size(v), 5, 0.01, NULL)
 *    x = 0
 *    do <until converged>
 *      v = pc(f(x))
 *      nka_correction(state, v)
 *      x = x - v
 *    end do
 *    nka_destroy(state)
 *
 *  The create and destroy can of course be moved outside any nonlinear
 *  solution procedure containing this iteration, and a single state variable
 *  used for repeated calls to the procedure.  This avoids the repeated
 *  allocations and deallocations of arrays associated with the state variable.
 *  In this case, one should either include a call to nka_restart() before the
 *  loop so that each iterative solve starts with clean slate, or include a
 *  call to nka_relax() after the loop so that first call to nka_correction()
 *  in the next iterative solve doesn't update the acceleration subspace with
 *  bogus information.
